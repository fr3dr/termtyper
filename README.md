# TermTyper

!["demo gif"](/demo.gif)

The inspiration to make this came from getting my first split column staggered keyboard.
Since I mainly work in the terminal, I also wanted a typing test in the terminal.
So I made this, and maybe someone else can find some use out of it as well.

## Installation
```
go install github.com/fr3dr/termtyper@latest
```
Run ```termtyper -h``` to show information about command line flags.

## Notice
This is a work in progress, please report any bugs/issues you may find.
